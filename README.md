pixelstitch
===========

Convert pixel art to cross stitching patterns.

There are plenty of other cross stitch pattern-makers online; however, most of them are too clever for my needs.  I don't need dithering or color correction or any of that nonsense; I just want to take things that are already pixel art and get back a pattern and the appropriate thread colors.

Also, unlike any other pattern-maker I've found, this one is open source, so those with fancier needs are welcome to fork it.
